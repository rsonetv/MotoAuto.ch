# CI/CD Workspace Configuration Fix

## Issue
The GitHub workflow "ðŸš€ CI/CD Pipeline" was failing with the error:
```
ERR_PNPM_INVALID_WORKSPACE_CONFIGURATION  packages field missing or empty
```

## Root Cause
The project structure includes a subdirectory `rsone/` with its own `package.json` file, making this a PNPM workspace project. However, the `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file was missing the required `packages` field to properly configure the workspace.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
**Before:**
```yaml
onlyBuiltDependencies:
  - '@tailwindcss/oxide'
```

**After:**
```yaml
packages:
  - '.'
  - 'rsone'

onlyBuiltDependencies:
  - '@tailwindcss/oxide'
```

### 2. Updated PNPM Version in CI/CD Workflow
**Before:**
```yaml
env:
  NODE_VERSION: '18'
  PNPM_VERSION: '8'
```

**After:**
```yaml
env:
  NODE_VERSION: '18'
  PNPM_VERSION: '10'
```

### 3. Updated Lockfile
Ran `pnpm install` to update the lockfile to include the new workspace configuration.

## Verification
âœ… `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` now works successfully
âœ… Workspace configuration is valid
âœ… Both root package and `rsone` package are properly included
âœ… Theme implementation remains fully functional

## Files Modified
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` - Added packages field for workspace configuration
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - Updated PNPM version from 8 to 10
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Updated to include workspace dependencies

The GitHub CI/CD pipeline should now pass successfully.
